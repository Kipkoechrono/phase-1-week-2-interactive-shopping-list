2. cd interactive-shopping-list
Open index.html in your web browser.

## Usage

3. To mark an item as purchased, click the "Mark Purchased" button next to the item.

## Code Explanation##

1. Initialization: The DOMContentLoaded event ensures that the JavaScript code executes only after the HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed.

2. Data Structure: itemList is an array that stores objects representing each item in the shopping list. Each item object has name (string) and purchased (boolean) properties.

3. Functions:

.**addItemToList**: Adds a new item to itemList and calls renderList() to update the DOM.
renderList(): Clears the existing list (listContainer), iterates over itemList, creates HTML elements (li and button) for each item, and appends them to listContainer. It also adds event listeners to each "Mark Purchased" button.
4. Event Listeners:

**addItemBtn**: Adds a new item to itemList when clicked.
markPurchasedBtn: Marks all items in itemList as purchased when clicked.
clearListBtn: Clears all items from itemList and updates the DOM accordingly.
